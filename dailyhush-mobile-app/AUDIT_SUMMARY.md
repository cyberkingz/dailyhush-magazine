## Recommendation: REMOVE Subscription for MVP

### Why Remove?

1. **User Experience**
   - Showing non-functional payment UI creates confusion
   - Alert messages look unprofessional
   - May cause app abandonment

2. **Launch Speed**
   - Saves ~8 days of development time
   - No Stripe setup needed
   - No webhook infrastructure required
   - No payment support overhead

3. **Better Analytics**
   - Measure feature usage without payment bias
   - Identify natural conversion points
   - Understand which features users value most

4. **Lower Risk**
   - No payment processing liability
   - No refund management
   - No subscription support tickets
   - Focus on core product value

### What to Do

**Immediate Actions (1-2 hours):**
1. Delete `app/subscription.tsx`
2. Delete `utils/stripe.ts`
3. Remove subscription link from settings
4. Remove premium upsell from insights
5. Update README to reflect FREE MVP

**Keep for Future:**
- Subscription types in `types/index.ts`
- Subscription state in store (not breaking anything)
- User profile structure (ready for Stripe IDs)

### When to Add Monetization

**Trigger Metrics:**
- ‚úÖ 5,000+ active users
- ‚úÖ 40%+ 7-day retention

- ‚úÖ Clear feature request patterns

### Pricing Strategy
