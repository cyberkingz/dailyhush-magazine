# Email CTR Tracking - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented end-to-end email tracking system to calculate Click-Through Rate (CTR) for all email campaigns.

**Formula:** CTR = (Clicks / Sends) × 100

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema
**Created:** `email_sends` table in Supabase

**Columns:**
- `id` - UUID primary key
- `utm_source` - Default 'email'
- `utm_medium` - Campaign type (google_sheet_invite, cold_sequence, retargeting, manual_blast)
- `utm_campaign` - Specific campaign name (email_2, quiz_invite, etc.)
- `utm_content` - Optional sub-campaign (day-0, day-1, etc.)
- `recipient_email` - Who received the email
- `send_batch_id` - Groups sends together
- `email_subject` - Subject line
- `n8n_workflow_id` - Which n8n workflow sent it
- `n8n_execution_id` - Specific execution ID
- `sent_at` - When email was sent
- `created_at` - Record creation timestamp

**Status:** ✅ Deployed to Supabase

---

### 2. n8n Integration Documentation
**Created:** `/N8N_EMAIL_TRACKING_INTEGRATION.md`

**Covers:**
- How to configure Supabase node in n8n workflows
- UTM parameter standards by campaign type
- Example configurations for each campaign type
- Testing & verification steps
- Troubleshooting guide

**Next Step:** Update your n8n email workflows to insert records into `email_sends` table after each successful send.

### 3. Analytics Queries Updated
**Modified:** `/src/lib/services/quiz.ts`

**Changes:**
- Updated `CampaignMetrics` interface to include:
  - `sends: number` - Total emails sent
  - `ctr: number` - Click-through rate
- Modified `getCampaignMetrics()` function to:
  - Query `email_sends` table
  - Join sends with clicks (quiz_sessions)
  - Calculate CTR for each campaign

**Calculation Logic:**
```typescript
const sends = sendsMap.get(campaign) || 0
const views = uniqueSessionCount // clicks
const ctr = sends > 0 ? (views / sends) * 100 : 0
```

---

### 4. Dashboard UI Updated
**Modified:** `/src/components/admin/analytics/CampaignPerformanceTable.tsx`

**New Features:**

**Summary Stats Bar (6 metrics):**
1. Total Sends
2. Total Clicks
3. **Average CTR** (highlighted in blue)
4. Total Starts
5. Total Completions
6. Average Conversion Rate

**Table Columns (9 columns):**
1. Campaign Name
2. **Sends** (new)
3. **Clicks** (renamed from "Views")
4. **CTR** (new, highlighted in blue)
5. Starts
6. Completions
7. Start Rate
8. Completion Rate
9. Overall Conversion

**Visual Enhancements:**
- CTR badge with color coding:
  - Green (≥5%): Excellent
  - Blue (2-5%): Good
  - Red (<2%): Needs improvement
- Sparklines for Sends column
- Totals row includes average CTR

## 📊 New Dashboard Metrics

### Before (Old Metrics)
```
Campaign: email_2
- Views: 450
- Starts: 234 (52%)
- Completions: 156 (35%)
```
**Missing:** How many emails were sent? What's the click rate?

### After (New Metrics)
```
Campaign: email_2
- Sends: 10,000 ← NEW
- Clicks: 450
- CTR: 4.5% ← NEW (450 / 10,000)
- Starts: 234 (52%)
- Completions: 156 (1.56% of sends)
```
**Complete funnel visibility!**

## 🎯 Recommended UTM Structure

We established clear standards for UTM parameters:

| Campaign Type | utm_source | utm_medium | utm_campaign | utm_content |
|---------------|------------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Google Sheet Invites** | `email` | `google_sheet_invite` | `quiz_invite` | - |
| **Cold Email Sequences** | `email` | `cold_sequence` | `email_2`, `email_3`, etc. | - |
| **One-off Blasts** | `email` | `manual_blast` | `[descriptive-name]` | - |
| **Post-Quiz Retargeting** | `email` | `retargeting` | `quiz-retargeting` | `day-0`, `day-1`, etc. |

**Key Benefit:** Using `utm_medium` to distinguish campaign types instead of campaign name matching.

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Update n8n Workflows**
   - Add Supabase insert node after email send
   - Use service_role key (not anon key)
   - Follow the guide in `N8N_EMAIL_TRACKING_INTEGRATION.md`

2. **Update Email Campaign UTM Parameters in Notion**
   - Fix cold email campaigns to use `utm_source=email`
   - Implement the recommended UTM structure
   - See `ALL_UTM_PARAMETERS_BY_CAMPAIGN.md` for full list

3. **Test the Integration**
   - Send a test email from n8n
   - Verify record appears in `email_sends` table
   - Click the email link
   - Check dashboard shows CTR correctly

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Email Open Tracking**
   - Add `email_opens` table
   - Calculate CTOR (Click-to-Open Rate)
   - Requires image pixel tracking or webhook from email provider

2. **Retargeting Email Analytics**
   - Create dedicated view for post-quiz retargeting
   - Compare performance: Day 0 vs Day 1 vs Day 3 vs Day 5 vs Day 7
   - Show email-level attribution (which specific email led to purchase)

3. **Campaign Type Classification**
   - Update `determineCampaignType()` to use `utm_medium` instead of name matching
   - More reliable and consistent

## 🧪 Testing Example

Once you add tracking to n8n, here's what the data flow looks like:

**Step 1: n8n sends email**
```sql
INSERT INTO email_sends (
  utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign,
  recipient_email, email_subject
) VALUES (
  'email', 'cold_sequence', 'email_2',
  'john@example.com', 'The neuroscience behind your overthinking'
);
```

**Step 2: User clicks email link**
```
https://daily-hush.com/quiz?utm_source=email&utm_medium=cold_sequence&utm_campaign=email_2
```

**Step 3: System tracks click**
```sql
INSERT INTO quiz_sessions (
  session_id, utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign
) VALUES (
  'abc-123', 'email', 'cold_sequence', 'email_2'
);
```

**Step 4: Dashboard calculates CTR**
```typescript
Sends = COUNT(*) FROM email_sends WHERE utm_campaign='email_2'  // 10,000
Clicks = COUNT(*) FROM quiz_sessions WHERE utm_campaign='email_2'  // 450
CTR = (450 / 10,000) * 100 = 4.5%
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **UTM Parameters Must Match Exactly**
   - Email send UTM must match email link UTM
   - Case-sensitive
   - Any mismatch = CTR won't calculate correctly

2. **Use Service Role Key in n8n**
   - Not the anon key
   - Required for inserting to `email_sends`

3. **Test with Small Batch First**
   - Don't update all workflows at once
   - Test with 10-20 emails first
   - Verify data appears correctly

4. **CTR Shows 0% Until You Add n8n Tracking**
   - This is expected
   - Historical emails can't be tracked (no send data)
   - New emails will show CTR once n8n integration is complete

---

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check `N8N_EMAIL_TRACKING_INTEGRATION.md` troubleshooting section
2. Verify UTM parameters match exactly
3. Confirm service_role key is being used in n8n
4. Check Supabase logs for insert errors

---

## Summary

You now have a complete email tracking system that calculates true CTR!

The dashboard will show:
- How many emails were sent
- How many people clicked (landed on your site)
- CTR percentage
- Complete funnel: Sends → Clicks → Starts → Completions

Next step: Update your n8n workflows to start tracking sends!
