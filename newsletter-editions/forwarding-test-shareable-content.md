# The Forwarding Test: How to Create Content So Good People Can't Help But Share It

(A letter from David Perell, founder of Write of Passage — for content creators who want their ideas to spread beyond their immediate audience)

---

## 📌 INTRODUCTION BY DAILYHUSH

At DailyHush, we don't believe in content for content's sake. We believe in ideas that are so valuable they demand to be shared.

Today, David Perell, who built Write of Passage into a 7-figure education business with 50,000+ newsletter subscribers, shares his secret weapon: **The Forwarding Test.** A framework that turns ordinary content into viral ideas that spread organically.

From struggling to get 100 people to read his content to having ideas shared by industry leaders and quoted in major publications. Not through social media manipulation, not through influencer relationships, but by creating content that passes the ultimate test: **Would I forward this to someone I respect?**

**This isn't about viral tricks — it's about creating value so dense that sharing becomes inevitable.**

David discovered that the most successful content creators don't chase virality. They create ideas so insightful, so useful, and so shareable that virality finds them. The difference between content that dies in someone's inbox and content that gets forwarded to thousands lies in understanding what makes ideas "forwarding-worthy."

Here's his framework. **Tested across 200+ pieces of content. Refined through data. With the exact triggers.**

David shares **the 7 forwarding triggers** that transform good content into shareable ideas, plus the psychology behind why people share certain ideas and ignore others.

**His key message:** _Don't create content for algorithms. Create content for **conversations**._

## 🔥 THE FORWARDING TEST — How I Turned 47 Subscribers Into 50,000 by Creating Content People Actually Want to Share

### The Email That Changed Everything

December 15th, 2019. I had 47 newsletter subscribers and was seriously considering quitting content creation.

I had been writing for 18 months, publishing consistently, following all the growth advice. My "engagement" was good according to the metrics — high open rates, decent click-throughs. But nothing was growing.

Then I wrote an essay called "Why You Should Write" and sent it to my tiny list.

**What happened next changed my understanding of content forever:**

Within 24 hours, that essay had been forwarded to over 200 people. Not shared on social media — actually forwarded via email and text. People were sending it to their friends, colleagues, and family members.

By the end of the week: 847 new subscribers.
By the end of the month: 2,100 new subscribers.
By the end of the quarter: 8,000 new subscribers.

**The difference?** For the first time, I had created something that passed what I now call "The Forwarding Test."

### The Psychology of Sharing: Why People Forward Content

After analyzing hundreds of pieces of viral content, I discovered that people share content for seven specific psychological reasons — and most content creators only trigger one or two of them.

**The sharing psychology research:**

**Dr. Jonah Berger** (Wharton, author of "Contagious"): "People don't share content that's merely good. They share content that makes them look good, feel good, or help others."

**The deeper truth:** Sharing is a social currency transaction. When someone forwards your content, they're spending their reputation to enhance someone else's day. They need to be confident the return is worth the investment.

**The seven forwarding triggers:**

**1. Social Currency (Makes the sharer look smart)**
Content that demonstrates the sharer's knowledge, taste, or access to valuable information.

**2. Practical Value (Solves real problems)**
Content that the recipient can immediately use to improve their life or work.

**3. Emotion Activation (Creates strong feelings)**
Content that makes people feel inspired, surprised, angry, or deeply moved.

**4. Public Identity (Aligns with sharer's values)**
Content that represents what the sharer believes and wants to be known for.

**5. Conversation Starter (Provokes discussion)**
Content that gives people something interesting to talk about.

**6. Secret Knowledge (Feels like insider information)**
Content that makes the recipient feel like they're getting behind-the-scenes insights.

**7. Status Enhancement (Makes both parties look good)**
Content that elevates both the sharer and recipient in their peer group.

**The forwarding math:** Content that triggers 1-2 of these gets read. Content that triggers 3-4 gets shared. Content that triggers 5+ goes viral.

### The Forwarding Test Framework

Before publishing any content, I now run it through this systematic test:

**The Forwarding Question:**
"If I received this content from someone I respect, would I immediately think of 2-3 specific people to forward it to?"

If the answer is no, the content doesn't get published.

**The specificity test:**
Can I name the exact people I would send this to? If I can't visualize specific faces and predict their reactions, the content isn't targeted enough.

**The "reputation risk" test:**
Would I bet my professional reputation on this content being valuable? If I wouldn't stake my credibility on it, why would others stake theirs by sharing it?

**The "coffee shop" test:**
Would someone bring this up in casual conversation? Great content becomes conversational currency.

### The 7 Forwarding Triggers in Action

Here's how to systematically build multiple triggers into your content:

**Trigger 1: Social Currency — Make the Sharer Look Smart**
- Share non-obvious insights that aren't widely known
- Include surprising statistics or research findings
- Provide frameworks that sound sophisticated but are easy to understand
- Reference credible sources and experts

*Example: "Here's what I learned from analyzing 1,000 successful entrepreneurs' schedules" (specific research + valuable insights)*

**Trigger 2: Practical Value — Solve Real Problems**
- Provide step-by-step instructions for common challenges
- Include templates, checklists, or frameworks people can use immediately
- Address specific pain points your audience faces daily
- Offer solutions that save time, money, or effort

*Example: "The 15-minute email template that gets 73% response rates" (specific solution + proven results)*

**Trigger 3: Emotion Activation — Create Strong Feelings**
- Tell personal stories with vulnerability and stakes
- Challenge conventional wisdom with compelling evidence
- Share triumph/failure narratives with clear lessons
- Use surprising or counterintuitive revelations

*Example: "Why I fired my most productive employee (and tripled team output)" (counterintuitive + story-driven)*

**Trigger 4: Public Identity — Align with Values**
- Take clear positions on important issues in your field
- Share content that helps people signal their beliefs
- Create content that represents aspirational identity
- Address values-based decisions and trade-offs

*Example: "Why I choose sustainable growth over venture capital" (clear values position)*

**Trigger 5: Conversation Starter — Provoke Discussion**
- Ask thought-provoking questions without obvious answers
- Present multiple perspectives on complex issues
- Share controversial but well-reasoned opinions
- Include discussion prompts and open-ended questions

*Example: "Should entrepreneurs optimize for happiness or impact?" (opens meaningful debate)*

**Trigger 6: Secret Knowledge — Behind-the-Scenes Insights**
- Share process details that most people don't know
- Reveal industry insider information (ethically)
- Explain the "why" behind successful strategies
- Provide access to exclusive data or research

*Example: "What I learned from reading 500 investor rejection emails" (exclusive access + insights)*

**Trigger 7: Status Enhancement — Elevate Both Parties**
- Create content that makes both sharer and recipient look good
- Provide sophisticated frameworks that are easy to understand
- Share high-quality insights from premium sources
- Offer content that enhances professional reputation

*Example: "The decision-making framework used by Jeff Bezos" (high-status source + practical application)*

### The Viral Content Anatomy

**Here's the structure of content that consistently gets forwarded:**

**Hook (First 30 seconds):**
- Surprising statistic or counterintuitive claim
- Specific, intriguing promise of value
- Personal story with clear stakes

**Value Delivery (Core content):**
- Multiple forwarding triggers woven throughout
- Specific, actionable insights
- Frameworks and mental models
- Concrete examples and case studies

**Conversation Catalyst (Ending):**
- Thought-provoking question
- Call for reader experiences or opinions
- Clear invitation to discuss or share

**Shareability Optimization:**
- Pull-out quotes that work on social media
- Key insights formatted for easy screenshot
- Clear, memorable one-liners
- Visual frameworks or lists

### The Content Multiplication Effect

**When content passes the forwarding test, it creates compound distribution:**

**Direct sharing:** Person A sends to Persons B, C, D
**Indirect sharing:** Persons B, C, D each send to their networks
**Social amplification:** People screenshot and share key insights on social media
**Reference multiplication:** Content gets cited and referenced in other content
**Search multiplication:** Shared content creates backlinks and improves SEO

**The exponential effect:** One piece of forwarding-worthy content can reach 50x more people than content that only gets read.

**My "Why You Should Write" essay:**
- Initial send: 47 people
- First-level forwards: 200+ people
- Second-level sharing: 2,000+ people
- Social media amplification: 15,000+ people
- Long-term organic discovery: 50,000+ people

### The Measurement Framework

**Traditional metrics miss the forwarding effect:**
- Open rates: Measures initial interest
- Click rates: Measures engagement
- Social shares: Measures broadcast sharing

**Forwarding metrics that matter:**
- Forward rate: How many people send it to others
- Conversation generation: How much discussion it creates
- Reference frequency: How often it gets cited
- Long-tail discovery: How many people find it months later

**The forwarding KPI:** If less than 5% of recipients forward your content to someone else, it's not forwarding-worthy.

### The Anti-Viral Mistakes Most Creators Make

**Mistake 1: Optimizing for algorithms instead of humans**
Creating content for social media feeds instead of meaningful human connections.

**Mistake 2: Pursuing novelty over value**
Focusing on being different instead of being useful.

**Mistake 3: Writing for everyone instead of someone**
Generic content that appeals to no one specifically.

**Mistake 4: Leading with credentials instead of insights**
Telling people why they should listen instead of giving them something worth hearing.

**Mistake 5: Copying viral formats instead of understanding viral principles**
Mimicking successful content without understanding why it worked.

**The forwarding revolution:** Create content so valuable that not sharing it would be selfish.

## 💡 WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT CREATING SHAREABLE CONTENT

1. **Virality isn't random — it's engineered.** Content that spreads widely isn't lucky; it systematically triggers multiple psychological sharing motivations.

2. **Specificity scales better than generality.** Content for "entrepreneurs" reaches no one. Content for "first-time founders struggling with imposter syndrome" reaches everyone who fits that description.

3. **Stories are more forwarding-worthy than advice.** People share stories that illustrate principles more than they share principles directly.

4. **Conversation beats consumption.** Content that generates discussion gets shared more than content that's merely consumed.

5. **The sharer's reputation is at stake.** People only forward content they're confident will make them look good to the recipient.

6. **Behind-the-scenes beats behind-the-desk.** Process insights and real experiences are more shareable than theoretical frameworks.

7. **Controversy with nuance spreads farther than safe consensus.** Taking thoughtful positions on complex issues generates more sharing than playing it safe.

8. **Value density matters more than content length.** Short content packed with insights gets shared more than long content with filler.

9. **The best content makes the reader the hero.** Focus on how the reader can use the insights, not how smart the writer is.

**⚠️ Important Note:** Creating forwarding-worthy content requires genuine value creation. These techniques amplify good content; they don't make bad content viral. Focus on creating real value first, optimization second.

## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: How do I measure if content is forwarding-worthy before publishing?**
A: Test it with a small group of trusted readers. Ask specifically: "Would you forward this to someone? Who?" If they can't name specific people, revise before publishing.

**Q: What if my niche is too specialized for viral content?**
A: Virality is relative to audience size. In specialized niches, content that gets forwarded to 10 key people can have huge impact. Focus on value density for your specific audience.

**Q: How do I balance forwarding-worthy content with regular publishing?**
A: Aim for 20% of your content to be forwarding-worthy. This becomes your growth engine while regular content maintains engagement. Quality compounds more than quantity.

**Q: What about content that's valuable but not shareable?**
A: Some content serves retention and trust-building rather than growth. The key is intentionally choosing which purpose each piece serves and optimizing accordingly.

**Q: How do I create controversial content without damaging my reputation?**
A: Take nuanced positions on complex issues rather than extreme positions on simple issues. Support your views with evidence and acknowledge other perspectives.

**Q: Does this approach work for all content formats?**
A: The principles apply across formats, but the execution varies. Email newsletters, blog posts, videos, and social media each have different forwarding mechanisms to optimize for.
