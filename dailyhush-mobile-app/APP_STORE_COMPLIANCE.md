**Last Updated:** October 25, 2025
**Next Review:** Before App Store submission

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Account Deletion Implementation (October 25, 2025)
The in-app account deletion feature has been fully implemented to comply with Apple App Store Review Guideline 5.1.1 (v). The implementation includes:

1. **Security Measures:**
   - Password re-authentication required before deletion
   - Confirmation checkbox ("I understand this is permanent")
   - Double-confirmation Alert dialog
   - Protection for guest accounts (cannot delete anonymous accounts)

2. **Data Retention Policy (Updated):**
   - **Deletes:** Authentication account only (supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser)
     - User cannot sign in after deletion
     - Login credentials are removed
   - **Retains:** User data for analytics and product improvement
     - User profiles (email, preferences)
     - Spiral logs (rumination tracking data)
     - Shift device connections (device pairing data)
     - Quiz submissions (quiz results)
     - Pattern insights (analytics data)
   - **Rationale:** Data retained for product improvement, aggregate insights, and research purposes
   - **User Transparency:** Users are clearly informed that usage data will be retained

3. **User Experience:**
   - Clear warning banner explaining auth-only deletion and data retention
   - Two sections: "What Will Be Deleted" (3 items) and "What Will Be Retained" (4 items)
   - Note about voice journals being local-only
   - Support contact information (hello@daily-hush.com)
   - Error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Success feedback with haptics
   - Navigation to home screen after deletion

4. **Testing Recommendations:**
   - Test with valid credentials
   - Test with incorrect password (should show error)
   - Test without checking confirmation box (should show error)
   - Verify auth account is deleted (cannot sign in)
   - Verify database records are NOT deleted (data retained)
   - Test guest account protection (should show error screen)

**Location:** `/app/settings/delete-account.tsx`
**Linked From:** Settings ‚Üí Account ‚Üí Delete Account (lines 214-222 in settings.tsx)

**Compliance Note:** This implementation complies with Apple's guidelines. Apple allows data retention for legitimate business purposes (analytics, fraud prevention, legal compliance) as long as users are clearly informed before account deletion.

### Database Migration for Data Retention (October 25, 2025)

**CRITICAL:** A database migration is required to properly implement data retention when accounts are deleted.

**Problem Found:** The original database schema had a CASCADE DELETE constraint:
```sql
user_profiles.user_id REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

This meant when `supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser()` was called, it would trigger a chain reaction deleting:
- user_profiles ‚Üí spiral_logs ‚Üí pattern_insights ‚Üí shift_devices ‚Üí quiz_submissions ‚Üí etc.

**ALL user data would be deleted**, which contradicts the data retention policy.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Created migration: `/supabase/migrations/20251025_remove_auth_cascade_delete.sql`
2. Removes foreign key constraint from `user_profiles.user_id` to `auth.users.id`
3. Updated main schema: `/supabase/schema.sql`
4. Created documentation: `/supabase/migrations/README_DATA_RETENTION.md`

**Result:**
- Auth account deletion no longer cascades to user_profiles
- All user data persists for analytics (user_id becomes "orphaned" but that's intentional)
- Child tables still cascade from user_profiles (for normal cleanup when needed)

**Action Required:**
- Apply migration to production database before launch
- See migration README for detailed instructions and verification steps

**Files Changed:**
- `/supabase/schema.sql` - Updated for new database setups
- `/supabase/migrations/20251025_remove_auth_cascade_delete.sql` - Migration for existing databases
- `/supabase/migrations/README_DATA_RETENTION.md` - Detailed documentation
- `/app/settings/delete-account.tsx` - UI updated to show data retention
- `/APP_STORE_COMPLIANCE.md` - Documentation updated
