## P.O.W.E.R Framework (Modern Georgi Style)

**Problem (Authentic Recognition):**
"I know what it's like to stare at your ad dashboard at 2 AM, wondering where you went wrong. I've been there. Most store owners have. The stress, the uncertainty, the fear that you're just not cut out for this..."

**Outcome (Transformation Vision):**
"But what if instead of feeling like you're always behind, you became the store owner others look up to? The one who figured it out. The one who built something meaningful that supports your family and community..."

**Why (Authentic Story + Proof):**
"Three years ago, I was helping store owners just like you when I noticed something. The ones who succeeded weren't necessarily smarter - they just had a system that worked. Let me share what I discovered..."

**Emotion (Identity + Community):**
"You started your store for a reason. Maybe it was freedom. Maybe it was to build something for your family. Maybe it was to prove something to yourself. That dream is still alive, and you're closer than you think..."

**Resistance (Modern Risk Reversal):**
"Look, I get it. You've probably been burned before. That's exactly why I created this guarantee. I'm not just protecting your investment - I'm investing in your success..."
