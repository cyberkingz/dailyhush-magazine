# Quiz-to-App Connection Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This feature connects website quiz takers with the DailyHush mobile app, enabling seamless account creation and data synchronization.

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema Changes
**File:** Database migration `add_quiz_connection_fields`

Added 5 new columns to `user_profiles` table:
- `quiz_email` - Email used to connect quiz results from website
- `quiz_connected` - Boolean flag indicating if user connected their quiz
- `quiz_submission_id` - UUID linking to quiz_submissions table
- `quiz_overthinker_type` - Type from quiz (catastrophizer, analyzer, worrier, ruminator)
- `quiz_connected_at` - Timestamp of when quiz was connected

**Existing Data:**
- `quiz_submissions` table already contains 229 quiz responses with email, overthinker_type, score, and result data
- `user_profiles` table has 38 mobile app users

### 2. New Screens Created

#### A. Quiz Recognition Screen
**File:** `app/onboarding/quiz-recognition.tsx`

**Purpose:** First screen in quiz connection flow - asks if user took the quiz

**Features:**
- Clean, welcoming UI with emerald green theme
- Two primary buttons: "Yes, I took the quiz" and "No, I'm new here"
- Tertiary link: "I'm not sure"
- Haptic feedback on interactions
- Routes to appropriate next screen based on choice

**Routing:**
- YES → `/onboarding/email-lookup`
- NO/Not Sure → `/onboarding/demo` (continues regular onboarding)

#### B. Email Lookup Screen
**File:** `app/onboarding/email-lookup.tsx`

**Purpose:** Validates email and looks up quiz submission

**Features:**
- Email input with real-time validation
- Queries `quiz_submissions` table for matching email
- Loading state during lookup
- Error handling for invalid emails or not found
- "Continue without quiz results" fallback option

**Routing:**
- Found → `/onboarding/password-setup` (with quiz data as params)
- Not Found → Shows error, user can retry or skip
- Skip → `/onboarding/demo`

#### C. Password Setup Screen
**File:** `app/onboarding/password-setup.tsx`

**Purpose:** Creates account for quiz users who found their email

**Features:**
- Password input with show/hide toggle
- Password confirmation field
- Minimum 8 character validation
- Creates Supabase auth account
- Creates user_profile with quiz connection fields populated
- Displays overthinker type from quiz
- Shows success and routes directly to home

**Flow:**
1. Receives email + quiz data from email lookup via route params
2. User creates password (just password, email already known)
3. Creates Supabase auth account with email + password
4. Creates user_profile with quiz connection fields:
   - `quiz_email`: email from params
   - `quiz_connected`: true
   - `quiz_submission_id`: from params
   - `quiz_overthinker_type`: from params
   - `quiz_connected_at`: current timestamp
   - `onboarding_completed`: true (skips rest of onboarding)
5. Updates local store with user data
6. Routes to home screen (skips regular onboarding)

### 3. Onboarding Integration
**File:** `app/onboarding/index.tsx` (modified)

**Changes:**
- Updated documentation to reflect new flow
- Modified `nextStep()` function to route to quiz-recognition after welcome screen
- Quiz flow is now inserted right after welcome screen

**New Flow:**
```
Welcome Screen
    ↓
Quiz Recognition
    ├─ YES → Email Lookup
    │           ├─ FOUND → Password Setup → Home ✅ (skip rest)
    │           └─ NOT FOUND → Error, retry or continue to Demo
    └─ NO/Not Sure → Demo → Assessment → Shift (conditional) → Complete → Home
```

## Testing Guide

### Test Case 1: Happy Path - Quiz User Found
**Goal:** Test successful quiz connection

1. Start the app (should show onboarding)
2. On Welcome screen, tap "Try It Now"
3. Should see Quiz Recognition screen
4. Tap "Yes, I took the quiz"
5. Should see Email Lookup screen
6. Enter a valid email from `quiz_submissions` table
   - Check database for existing emails: `SELECT email FROM quiz_submissions LIMIT 10;`
7. Tap "Find My Quiz"
8. Should see "Great! We Found You" password setup screen
9. Should display overthinker type from quiz
10. Enter password (min 8 chars) and confirm
11. Tap "Create Account"
12. Should create account and route directly to Home screen
13. **Verify in database:**
    - New row in `user_profiles` with:
      - `quiz_connected = true`
      - `quiz_email` matches entered email
      - `quiz_submission_id` is populated
      - `quiz_overthinker_type` is populated
      - `onboarding_completed = true`

### Test Case 2: Email Not Found
**Goal:** Test graceful handling when email doesn't exist in quiz_submissions

1. Complete steps 1-6 from Test Case 1
2. Enter an email that's NOT in quiz_submissions (e.g., "nonexistent@test.com")
3. Tap "Find My Quiz"
4. Should show error: "We couldn't find a quiz with this email..."
5. User can:
   - Retry with different email
   - Tap "Continue without quiz results" to proceed to Demo

### Test Case 3: New User Flow
**Goal:** Test that new users can bypass quiz flow

1. Start the app
2. On Welcome screen, tap "Try It Now"
3. Should see Quiz Recognition screen
4. Tap "No, I'm new here"
5. Should route to Demo screen
6. Continue through normal onboarding flow: Demo → Assessment → Complete

### Test Case 4: Unsure Option
**Goal:** Test "I'm not sure" tertiary link

1. Start the app
2. Complete to Quiz Recognition screen
3. Tap "I'm not sure" link
4. Should route to Demo screen (same as "No")

5. Tap back button
6. Should return to Email Lookup screen

## Database Queries for Testing

### Check existing quiz submissions
```sql
SELECT id, email, overthinker_type, score, created_at
FROM quiz_submissions
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check user profiles with quiz connection
```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  email,
  quiz_email,
  quiz_connected,
  quiz_overthinker_type,
  quiz_connected_at,
  onboarding_completed
FROM user_profiles
WHERE quiz_connected = true
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Verify quiz connection works
```sql
SELECT
  up.email as user_email,
  up.quiz_email,
  up.quiz_overthinker_type,
  qs.overthinker_type as quiz_type,
  qs.score as quiz_score
FROM user_profiles up
LEFT JOIN quiz_submissions qs ON up.quiz_submission_id = qs.id
WHERE up.quiz_connected = true;
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Created Files:

## Features Implemented

✅ Database schema with quiz connection fields
✅ Quiz recognition screen with clear options
✅ Email lookup with real-time validation
✅ Quiz submission lookup from database
✅ Password-only account creation (email already known)
✅ Auto-populate user profile with quiz data
✅ Skip rest of onboarding for quiz users

## Next Steps

1. **Test the flow end-to-end** using the test cases above
2. **Monitor conversion metrics:**
   - % of users who click "Yes, I took the quiz"
   - % of quiz users who successfully connect (email found)
   - % of quiz users who complete password setup
3. **Consider enhancements:**
   - Pre-fill email if coming from website with email parameter
   - Show quiz insights on first home screen visit
   - Send welcome email to quiz users who connect
   - Track quiz-to-app conversion in analytics

## Technical Notes

- Uses Supabase MCP for database operations
- Leverages `withRetry` utility for robust profile creation
- Follows existing app design patterns (emerald theme, haptics, safe areas)
- Uses expo-router for navigation with type-safe routing
- Password setup screen sets `onboarding_completed = true` to skip remaining onboarding
- Quiz data is immutable - stored at connection time, not updated from quiz_submissions

## Known Limitations

1. No email verification - assumes quiz emails are valid
2. Duplicate email handling - if email exists in both quiz_submissions and user_profiles, user can't connect
3. No way to disconnect or re-connect quiz data after initial connection
4. Quiz data is snapshot at connection time - doesn't update if quiz is retaken

**Implementation Complete:** All screens created, database updated, and onboarding flow integrated. Ready for end-to-end testing.
