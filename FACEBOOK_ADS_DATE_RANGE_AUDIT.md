- **Comprehensive error handling**
- **Detailed logging for debugging**
- **Full timezone normalization to UTC**
- **Complete documentation**

---

## Issues Found & Resolved

### 0. **Content Security Policy Blocking Facebook Graph API** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- CSP `connect-src` directive was missing `https://graph.facebook.com`
- Facebook Ads API calls were being blocked with error: "Refused to connect... violates Content Security Policy"
- Only `https://www.facebook.com` was whitelisted, not the Graph API endpoint

**Solution:**
- Added `https://graph.facebook.com` to CSP `connect-src` directive in both:
  - `netlify.toml` (line 37) - for Netlify production deployment
  - `public/_redirects` (line 30) - for backup/fallback CSP configuration
- No CSP in `index.html` (local development unrestricted, as intended)

**Impact:**
- Facebook Ads API calls now work in production
- No change to local development environment
- Security maintained - only specific Facebook domain whitelisted

**Locations:**
- `netlify.toml:37`
- `public/_redirects:30`

---

### 1. **Date Format Inconsistency** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- ISO strings from React date picker (e.g., `2025-01-15T23:59:59.999Z`) were directly split to get YYYY-MM-DD
- No validation of date format before conversion
- Potential timezone issues when converting dates

**Solution:**
- Created `formatDateForFacebook()` utility function
- Normalizes all dates to UTC using `getUTCFullYear()`, `getUTCMonth()`, `getUTCDate()`
- Proper validation before conversion
- Handles both string and Date inputs

**Location:** `src/lib/services/facebookAds.ts:59-78`

---

### 2. **Missing Date Range Validation** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- No validation that start date comes before end date
- No validation that dates are valid
- No warnings for future dates
- Could cause silent failures or incorrect API calls

**Solution:**
- Created `validateDateRange()` function that checks:
  - Start and end dates are valid Date objects
  - Start date is not after end date
  - Warns if dates are in the future
- Throws descriptive errors for invalid ranges

**Location:** `src/lib/services/facebookAds.ts:83-104`

---

### 3. **Insufficient Error Logging** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- Generic error messages made debugging difficult
- No visibility into date range values during API calls
- No indication if API returned empty data vs. error

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive logging at every stage:
  - Initial date range received
  - Formatted date values sent to Facebook API
  - API response metadata
  - Success/failure with metrics summary
- All sensitive data (access tokens) redacted from logs
- Structured log objects for easy debugging

**Locations:**
- `src/lib/services/facebookAds.ts:124-129, 165-169, 186-199, 222-229`
- `src/lib/services/trackingAnalytics.ts:1273-1277, 1288-1294, 1307-1313`
- `src/hooks/useTrackingAnalytics.ts:230-234, 246, 254-257`

---

### 4. **Missing Documentation** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- No documentation of date flow through the system
- No explanation of timezone handling
- No comments on format requirements

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to all functions
- Documented full date range flow in OverviewView component
- Explained Facebook API requirements
- Added inline comments for complex logic

**Locations:**
- `src/lib/services/facebookAds.ts:1-10`
- `src/components/admin/tracking/OverviewView.tsx:25-35`

---

### 5. **Inconsistent Error Handling** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- Some functions returned empty arrays on error
- Some returned zero metrics
- No structured error information
- Stack traces not captured

**Solution:**
- Standardized error handling across all functions
- Always return safe fallback values to prevent UI crashes
- Capture and log full error details including stack traces
- Include context (date range) in all error logs

**Locations:**
- `src/lib/services/facebookAds.ts:232-251, 393-399`
- `src/lib/services/trackingAnalytics.ts:1336-1358`

3. HOOK: useTrackingAnalytics.ts
   └─> Logs date range received
   └─> Passes to analytics functions

4. SERVICE: trackingAnalytics.ts
   └─> Logs ROAS calculation start
   └─> Passes to Facebook Ads service and revenue service in parallel

5. FACEBOOK SERVICE: facebookAds.ts

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist:

1. **Default Date Range (No Selection)**
   - [ ] Verify dashboard loads with last 30 days of data
   - [ ] Check browser console for "default date range" logs
   - [ ] Confirm metrics are calculated correctly

2. **Custom Date Range**
   - [ ] Select date range in picker
   - [ ] Verify console shows "custom date range" logs
   - [ ] Confirm formatted dates are YYYY-MM-DD
   - [ ] Verify metrics update correctly

3. **Edge Cases**
   - [ ] Select same day for start and end
   - [ ] Select date range spanning months
   - [ ] Select very recent dates (today/yesterday)
   - [ ] Verify end of day handling (23:59:59.999)

4. **Error Cases**
   - [ ] Check behavior with invalid Facebook credentials
   - [ ] Verify graceful degradation on API errors
   - [ ] Confirm zero metrics returned instead of crashes

5. **Console Verification**
   Look for these log patterns:
   ```

## Console Logging Guide

When debugging date range issues, look for these log patterns in the browser console:

### Success Pattern:
```
🔄 useOverviewAnalytics: Fetching data with date range: { hasDateRange: true, ... }
📅 Using custom date range: { rawStart: "...", formattedStart: "2025-01-01", ... }
🔵 Fetching Facebook Ads Insights...
📦 Facebook Ads API response: { hasData: true, dataLength: 1, ... }
✅ Facebook Ads Insights fetched successfully: { spend: 100, impressions: 5000, ... }
📊 Raw metrics fetched: { facebookSpend: 100, shopifyRevenue: 500, ... }
✅ Facebook Ads ROAS calculated: { roas: "5.00", cpa: "20.00", ... }
✅ useOverviewAnalytics: All metrics fetched successfully
```

### Error Pattern:
```
🔄 useOverviewAnalytics: Fetching data with date range...
📅 Using custom date range...
🔵 Fetching Facebook Ads Insights...
❌ Facebook Ads API error: { status: 400, error: {...}, dateRange: {...} }
❌ Error fetching Facebook Ads insights: { error: "...", dateRange: "..." }
❌ useOverviewAnalytics: Error fetching analytics: { error: "...", ... }
```

## Timezone Handling

All dates are now normalized to UTC to prevent timezone-related issues:

### Before:
```typescript
const date = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]  // ❌ Uses local timezone
```

### After:
```typescript
function formatDateForFacebook(date: string | Date): string {
  const d = typeof date === 'string' ? new Date(date) : date
  const year = d.getUTCFullYear()
  const month = String(d.getUTCMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0')
  const day = String(d.getUTCDate()).padStart(2, '0')
  return `${year}-${month}-${day}`  // ✅ Always UTC
}
```

---

## Critical Fix: Content Security Policy

**IMPORTANT:** The most critical issue discovered during this audit was the **Content Security Policy blocking Facebook Graph API calls**.

### The Problem:
```
❌ Refused to connect to 'https://graph.facebook.com/...'
   because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive
```

### The Fix:
Added `https://graph.facebook.com` to CSP `connect-src` directive in:
- `netlify.toml`
- `public/_redirects`

### Why This Matters:
- Without this fix, Facebook Ads API calls were **completely blocked in production**
- The error was silent in local development (no CSP enforcement)
- This would only manifest after deploying to Netlify

### Deployment Instructions:
1. **Commit all changes** including CSP updates
2. **Deploy to Netlify** - the new CSP will take effect immediately
3. **Clear browser cache** after deployment (CSP is cached by browsers)
4. **Test** the admin dashboard - Facebook Ads metrics should now load

### Verification After Deployment:
Open browser DevTools → Console, you should see:
```
✅ Facebook Ads Insights fetched successfully: { spend: X, impressions: Y, ... }
```

Instead of:
```
❌ Refused to connect... violates Content Security Policy
```
