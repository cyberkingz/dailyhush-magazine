# DailyHush Splash Screen - Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure proper implementation and testing of the splash screen.

---

## Pre-Implementation

- [ ] Review design specification (`SPLASH_SCREEN_DESIGN.md`)
- [ ] Review visual guide (`SPLASH_SCREEN_VISUAL_GUIDE.md`)
- [ ] Review integration guide (`SPLASH_SCREEN_INTEGRATION.md`)
- [ ] Check example implementations (`SplashScreen.example.tsx`)
- [ ] Ensure team alignment on design

---

## Installation & Dependencies

- [ ] Install required dependencies:
  ```bash
  npx expo install expo-linear-gradient react-native-svg
  ```

- [ ] Verify React Native version compatibility (>= 0.70)
- [ ] Verify Expo SDK version (>= 49)
- [ ] Check if TypeScript is configured properly

---

## Component Setup

- [ ] Copy `SplashScreen.tsx` to `/components/` directory
- [ ] Verify imports resolve correctly
- [ ] Check for any TypeScript errors
- [ ] Ensure component exports properly

---

## Integration

Choose your integration approach:

### Option A: Basic Integration
- [ ] Import SplashScreen in `app/_layout.tsx`
- [ ] Add state management for splash visibility
- [ ] Add `onAnimationComplete` callback
- [ ] Test basic show/hide functionality

### Option B: Async Initialization
- [ ] Create initialization function
- [ ] Track loading state separately from animation state
- [ ] Add error handling for failed initialization
- [ ] Test with slow network conditions

### Option C: Minimum Display Time
- [ ] Add timer for minimum display duration
- [ ] Coordinate with data loading state
- [ ] Ensure smooth transition after both complete
- [ ] Test with fast initialization (< 2s)

---

## Expo Configuration

- [ ] Update `app.json` splash configuration:
  ```json
  "splash": {
    "image": "./assets/splash-simple.png",
    "resizeMode": "contain",
    "backgroundColor": "#0A1612"
  }
  ```

- [ ] Create simple `splash-simple.png` asset:
  - Size: 1242×2688px (highest iOS resolution)
  - Background: Solid #0A1612
  - Optional: Simple "DailyHush" text centered
  - This shows while React Native loads

- [ ] Test Expo splash → Custom splash transition

---

## Styling & Theme

- [ ] Verify background color matches app theme (#0A1612)
- [ ] Check that colors match design spec:
  - [ ] Background: #0A1612
  - [ ] Gradient: #0D1F1A
  - [ ] Accent: #34D399
  - [ ] Light accent: #6EE7B7
  - [ ] Text: #ECFDF5

- [ ] Test gradient rendering on both platforms
- [ ] Verify text is readable and properly styled

---

## Animation Testing

- [ ] Test animation sequence:
  - [ ] Background fade in (0-0.4s)
  - [ ] Logo appears and slides up (0.4-1.0s)
  - [ ] Spiral appears and rotates (0.4-1.6s)
  - [ ] Tagline appears (1.6-2.0s)
  - [ ] Loading dots animate (if enabled)

- [ ] Verify animations run at 60fps
- [ ] Check that `useNativeDriver: true` is set
- [ ] Test animation timing feels natural
- [ ] Verify no animation stuttering

---

## Visual Elements

### Moon Icon
- [ ] Verify moon icon renders correctly
- [ ] Check crescent shape is visible
- [ ] Verify accent dots appear
- [ ] Check opacity is correct (0.9 for main shape)

### Breaking Spiral
- [ ] Verify spiral graphic renders
- [ ] Check three arcs are visible
- [ ] Verify arcs have breaks/gaps
- [ ] Check rotation animation works
- [ ] Verify accent dots appear at break points
- [ ] Check opacity levels (0.3, 0.5, 0.7 for arcs)

### Typography
- [ ] Verify app name displays correctly
- [ ] Check font size (42px)
- [ ] Verify letter spacing (1.5px)
- [ ] Check tagline displays correctly
- [ ] Verify tagline opacity (0.8)

### Loading Indicator
- [ ] Test loading dots appear when enabled
- [ ] Verify wave animation works
- [ ] Check dot sizing (8×8px)

#### iOS-Specific Checks
- [ ] Verify safe area handling (notch/Dynamic Island)
- [ ] Check top safe area (60px padding)
- [ ] Check bottom safe area (40px padding)
- [ ] Test status bar appearance (light content)
- [ ] Verify SF Pro font renders correctly

### Android Testing

- [ ] Test on small Android phone (5")

- [ ] Test on Android tablet

#### Android-Specific Checks
- [ ] Verify safe area handling (status bar)

- [ ] Check bottom safe area (30px padding)
- [ ] Test with gesture navigation
- [ ] Verify Roboto font renders correctly
- [ ] Test on various Android versions (10, 11, 12, 13, 14)

---

## Performance Testing

- [ ] Test app cold start (completely closed)
- [ ] Test app warm start (from background)
- [ ] Verify animations run smoothly (60fps)
- [ ] Check memory usage during splash
- [ ] Test with Performance Monitor enabled
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks

### Performance Benchmarks

- [ ] CPU usage is reasonable

---

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

- [ ] Test with very slow initialization (> 5s)
- [ ] Test with failed initialization
- [ ] Test with no internet connection
- [ ] Test rapid app restarts
- [ ] Test app crash and recovery
- [ ] Test with interrupted initialization

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] Network timeout during init
- [ ] Auth restoration failure
- [ ] Data loading failure
- [ ] Missing assets or resources
- [ ] Unexpected errors

---

## Accessibility

- [ ] Test with VoiceOver (iOS)
- [ ] Test with TalkBack (Android)

  - [ ] Text (#ECFDF5) on background (#0A1612): 15.2:1 ✓
  - [ ] Accent (#34D399) on background: 9.8:1 ✓

- [ ] Test with large text size settings
- [ ] Test with bold text enabled
- [ ] Check reduced motion preference:
  ```tsx
  AccessibilityInfo.isReduceMotionEnabled()
  ```
- [ ] Verify no essential information is conveyed by animation alone

---

## User Experience

- [ ] Splash doesn't feel too slow (< 3s total)
- [ ] Splash doesn't feel too fast (> 1s minimum)
- [ ] Transition to main app is smooth
- [ ] No jarring flashes or jumps
- [ ] Loading state is clear (if applicable)
- [ ] User understands app is loading

### UX Considerations
- [ ] Does splash create positive first impression?
