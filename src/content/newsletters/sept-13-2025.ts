    <h3>1. Collagen Supplements That Actually Deliver</h3>
    <p>Collagen is your skin's scaffolding, and by 30 we're losing 1% a year. A <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/9/2080" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 meta-analysis</a> of 26 trials (1,721 people) found oral hydrolyzed collagen <strong>improved skin elasticity and hydration</strong> within 8–12 weeks. No, it's not a facelift, but it's one of the few supplements with real clinical backing.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Look for 2.5–10g of hydrolyzed collagen peptides daily, paired with vitamin C for synthesis support.
    </p>

    <h3>2. NAD+: Cellular Energy = Youthful Skin</h3>
    <p>NAD+ levels drop as we age, slowing DNA repair and cell renewal. A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.70093" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025 trial in *Aging Cell*</a> showed NAD+ precursor NR improved cardiovascular and skin health in patients with premature aging. For beauty, that means <strong>better repair and resilience</strong> at the cellular level.</p>
    <p><em>How to boost it:</em> Supplements like NR/NMN, or naturally through exercise and intermittent fasting.</p>

    <h3>3. Retinoids vs. Bakuchiol: Old Guard vs. New Wave</h3>
    <p>Retinoids remain the <strong>gold standard for wrinkle reduction</strong>, proven to stimulate collagen and fade lines. But irritation is real. Enter bakuchiol, a plant-based alternative. A <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjd/article/180/2/289/5420241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12-week clinical trial</a> found bakuchiol performed <strong>as well as retinol on wrinkles and pigmentation</strong> — with fewer side effects. Dermatologists still call it "promising, not proven," but it's a gentler option if your skin can't handle retinoids.</p>

    <h3>Today's Task — Audit Your Longevity Routine</h3>
    <p>List your current anti-aging steps. Do you have: UV protection, a collagen source, a retinoid (or alternative), and something targeting cellular health? Missing one? That's your next upgrade.</p>
