    text: "My daughter recommended this after I mentioned I was having trouble sleeping. I'm 67 and I've been worrying about my husband's health for months now - his blood pressure, his cholesterol, whether he's hiding symptoms from me. Wore this for about a week before I really understood how to use it properly. Now I use it in the evening when my mind starts racing about what the doctor said at his last appointment. Takes a minute or two and I can feel myself calming down. The rose gold is pretty, goes with everything I own.",

    text: "This works but don't expect instant results. Took me several days to figure out the breathing pattern—I kept making the exhale too short at first. I tend to imagine the worst about everything: my son's job situation, my husband's blood pressure, whether I upset my sister in that conversation last week. This helps interrupt the worry spiral when I use it. I'm 65 and honestly felt a bit silly breathing through a necklace at first, but once I got the hang of it, it's been helpful. I wish the chain came a bit longer because I'm tall and it sits higher than I'd prefer. But overall it's helping.",

What if my husband's cholesterol numbers mean something serious? This has been helpful when I start getting into my head about these things. It's not a miracle cure but it helps me reset. I used it before a difficult conversation with my son last week and it made a genuine difference in how I handled myself.",

    text: "My doctor suggested breathing exercises for my blood pressure, but I kept forgetting to do them. Having this around my neck means I actually remember—I wear it all the time so it's right there when I need it. I use it before my weekly calls with my elderly mother, before bed when I start replaying conversations with my kids, sometimes just sitting in the garden. At 68, my memory isn't what it used to be! The sterling silver is really attractive and several friends have asked about it. Gets compliments.",

It does help especially at night when I'm replaying every conversation I had with my daughter that day. Did I criticize her too much? Should I apologize? I do forget to use it during the day sometimes. Maybe I need to build the habit more. The rose gold is lovely though.",

Should I say something to my son about screen time? Did I overstep last weekend? Been wearing this for a few weeks and when those thoughts start spiraling I use it. The matte finish is nice because it's subtle. People just think it's a necklace, not a breathing tool. That's what I wanted.",

You'd think I'd worry less but now I obsess about different things - my husband's health, money lasting through retirement, whether I'm being a difficult mother-in-law. This has become part of my morning routine. Coffee, then I use the necklace, then I can start my day without that tight feeling in my chest. Doesn't solve my problems but stops me from dwelling on them for hours. It's also attractive which is a plus.",

    text: "My sons are 38 and 41, both married with kids, and I STILL worry about them like they're teenagers. One is going through a divorce and the other just lost his job. Am I being supportive enough? Too much? Did I raise them to handle this? I'm 66 and thought this phase would be over by now! This necklace helps when I catch myself going down the rabbit hole. I wear it every day and use it while doing dishes, watching the news, before bed. My husband hasn't really noticed it which is fine - I wanted something just for me.",

Takes about 90 seconds and I feel more settled. Also use it after we talk if the conversation didn't go well, helps me move forward instead of replaying the entire call in my head for hours. I'm 70 and never thought a piece of jewelry would help with anxiety, but here we are. The color goes with all my clothes.",

I use it when I start worrying about my mother's dementia or replaying arguments with my siblings about her care. Works fairly well. My only complaint is I wish the chain were slightly shorter - I have a short neck and it hangs a bit lower than ideal.",

I still overthink sometimes, especially when I wake up in the middle of the night, but at least I'm not making it worse by overexplaining.

She suggested getting something physical to remind me so I got this. Had it about 5 months I think. I wear it to doctor appointments (health anxiety is very real), stressful phone calls with insurance people, basically whenever my chest starts feeling tight. She's noticed I'm actually using the breathing techniques more which makes our sessions more productive I guess? It's not fixing everything but it's helping more than the apps and stuff I tried before.",
