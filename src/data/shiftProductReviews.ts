Didn't really get what it was supposed to do until it arrived and I read the instructions. been wearing it for like a week and idk, it actually helps? I use it when I'm anxious at work. takes like a minute or two and I feel calmer. also goes with everything which is nice",

I always imagine worst case scenarios about literally everything and this does help stop my brain from going there AS much. Wish it came with a longer chain option cause im tall and it sits kinda high. Otherwise good product",

I worry about EVERYTHING - parent emails, lesson plans, did I say the wrong thing to a student, etc etc. This has been really helpful for when I start getting in my head. Not a cure but it helps me reset. Used it before a tough parent meeting last week and it genuinely made a difference",

I breathe through it before going into target (weird I know but stores stress me out), before bed, sometimes just on the couch. the silver is really pretty btw, got 3 compliments already",

I forget to use it during the day tho which is annoying. maybe I just need to build the habit more idk. rose gold is super pretty tho",

Been using this on my breaks and honestly after rough shifts. The matte color is good because it doesn't stand out under my scrubs. Nobody knows its a breathing tool they just think its a necklace",
