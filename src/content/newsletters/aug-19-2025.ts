    <h2>SPF That Works In Real Life</h2>
    <p>Choose by UV filters and texture, not marketing. Aim for SPF 30+ with high UVA protection (look for PA++++ or "broad spectrum"). Reapply if outdoors >2 hours or after sweat/swim.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mineral: great for sensitivity; watch white cast.</li>
      <li>Chemical: elegant textures, better for deeper tones.</li>
      <li>Hybrid: best of both, often most wearable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Two killers of otherwise perfect routines: under‑application (<strong>use 2–3 fingers</strong>) and skipping reapplication.</p>
