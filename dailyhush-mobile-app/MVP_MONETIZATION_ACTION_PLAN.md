# DailyHush MVP - Monetization Action Plan
## Remove Subscription for FREE Launch

**Decision:** Remove all subscription/payment UI for MVP launch
**Rationale:** MVP is FREE - payment infrastructure creates confusion and delays launch

---

## IMMEDIATE CHANGES (Do This Now)

### Step 1: Remove Subscription Files

```bash
# Delete these files completely
rm app/subscription.tsx
rm utils/stripe.ts
```

### Step 2: Update Settings Screen

**File:** `app/settings.tsx`

**Remove lines 127-136:**
```typescript
// DELETE THIS BLOCK:
<SettingRow
  title="Subscription"
  subtitle="Free Plan"
  value="Upgrade"
  icon={<CreditCard size={20} color="#52B788" strokeWidth={2} />}
  onPress={() => {
    Haptics.selectionAsync();
    router.push('/subscription' as any);
  }}
/>
```

**Also remove the import:**
```typescript
// Remove CreditCard from the import list (line 13)
import {
  ArrowLeft,
  User,
  // CreditCard, ← DELETE THIS
  Bluetooth,
  Moon,
  Bell,
  Type,
  HelpCircle,
  Mail,
  Shield,
  ChevronRight
} from 'lucide-react-native';
```

### Step 3: Update Insights Screen

**File:** `app/insights.tsx`

**Remove lines 137-148:**
```typescript
// DELETE THIS BLOCK:
{/* Premium Upsell */}
<View className="bg-[#2D6A4F] border border-[#40916C]/30 rounded-2xl p-5">
  <Text className="text-[#E8F4F0] text-lg font-bold mb-2">
    Unlock Advanced Insights
  </Text>
  <Text className="text-[#B7E4C7] text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
    Get daily predictions, custom reframes, and export reports for your therapist.
  </Text>
  <Text className="text-[#95B8A8] text-xs">
    Premium: $9.99/month
  </Text>
</View>
```

### Step 4: Update README

**File:** `README.md`

**Change this section:**
```markdown
# BEFORE:
- **Free → Paid Conversion** | 10% |

# AFTER:
**MVP is 100% FREE** - All features available to all users during initial launch phase
```

**Add this notice at the top:**
```markdown
## 🎉 FREE MVP Launch

DailyHush MVP is completely free while we validate product-market fit.
All features (spiral interrupts, F.I.R.E. training, pattern insights, Shift integration)
are available to all users with no payment required.

Premium features and subscriptions will be introduced after MVP validation (est. 3-6 months post-launch).
```

### Step 5: Clean Up Type Definitions (Optional - Keep for Future)

**File:** `types/index.ts`

**No changes needed** - Keep the Subscription types for future use:
```typescript
// Keep these for future premium tier implementation
export enum SubscriptionTier {
  FREE = 'free',
  MONTHLY = 'monthly',
  ANNUAL = 'annual',
}

export interface Subscription {
  // ... keep as-is
}
```

### Step 6: Clean Up Store (Optional - Keep for Future)

**File:** `store/useStore.ts`

**No changes needed** - Keep subscription state management:
```typescript
// Keep these for future use
subscription: null,
setSubscription: (subscription) => set({ subscription }),
```

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After making changes, verify:

- [ ] App builds successfully: `npm run ios` or `npm run android`
- [ ] Settings screen loads without subscription row
- [ ] Insights screen loads without premium upsell
- [ ] No broken imports or missing files
- [ ] No console errors about missing routes
- [ ] Navigation flows work correctly
- [ ] Type checking passes: `npx tsc --noEmit`

## WHAT TO KEEP (Don't Delete)

**Keep these for future premium tier:**

1. **Type Definitions** (`types/index.ts`)
   - `SubscriptionTier` enum
   - `Subscription` interface
   - Needed when premium launches

2. **Store State** (`store/useStore.ts`)
   - `subscription` state
   - `setSubscription` action
   - `useSubscription` selector
   - Not breaking anything by keeping it

3. **User Profile** (`types/index.ts`)
   - Already has structure for subscription data
   - Ready for future Stripe integration

---

## FUTURE: When to Add Premium (3-6 Months)

**Trigger Conditions:**
- ✅ 5,000+ active users
- ✅ 40%+ 7-day retention rate
- ✅ 3+ spiral interrupts per user per day
- ✅ Clear feature usage patterns identified
- ✅ User feedback requests premium features

**What to Build Then:**
1. Set up Stripe account (start with test mode)
2. Create Supabase Edge Functions for API endpoints
3. Build new subscription.tsx with real Stripe integration
4. Install `@stripe/stripe-react-native` package
5. Create Supabase subscriptions table
6. Implement webhook handlers
7. Add feature gates for premium content
8. Launch with 7-day free trial
