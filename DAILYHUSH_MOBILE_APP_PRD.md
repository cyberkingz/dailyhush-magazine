# DailyHush Mobile App - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Owner:** Product Team
**Status:** Draft for Review

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Vision
DailyHush mobile app is the first mental health app designed specifically for women 65+ who experience chronic rumination—not anxiety about the future, but shame-driven replaying of past conversations and events.

### The Gap in Market
Current meditation apps (Calm, Headspace, Insight Timer) target general anxiety with techniques that don't work for chronic ruminators. They assume users need to "calm down" when the real problem is interrupting pre-conscious shame spirals before they lock in.

### Our Solution
A mobile companion to The Shift breathing necklace that delivers:
1. **Real-time spiral interruption** (not "calm meditation sessions")
2. **F.I.R.E. Protocol training** (clinically-backed rumination intervention)
3. **Pattern tracking** (shows what triggers YOUR spirals)
4. **Physical product integration** (pairs with The Shift necklace)

### Why Now
- **30,000 quiz completions** showing demand for rumination-specific tools
- **6,000+ Shift buyers** requesting digital companion app
- **65+ women** are fastest-growing smartphone demographic (92% smartphone ownership, Pew 2023)
- **Stage 5 market**: Exhausted with generic meditation apps that don't work

---

## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

### The Core Problem
Women 65+ experience chronic rumination—replaying conversations with adult children, second-guessing everything they said at dinner, lying awake at 3AM analyzing a text message from 3 days ago.

**This is NOT general anxiety. This is a shame-driven, pre-conscious loop.**

### Why Current Solutions Fail

**Meditation Apps (Calm, Headspace):**
- ❌ Require 10-20 minute sessions (ruminators need 90-second interrupts)
- ❌ Focus on "future anxiety" not "past shame"
- ❌ Assume you can remember to open the app mid-spiral (you can't)
- ❌ Generic content, not rumination-specific protocols

**Therapy:**
- ❌ Expensive ($150-200/hour)
- ❌ Weekly sessions = 6 days without support
- ❌ Traditional CBT doesn't target rumination loops specifically
- ❌ Can't access therapist at 3AM when spiraling

**The Shift Necklace (Physical Product):**
- ✅ Works for vagal nerve activation
- ❌ Doesn't teach WHY you're spiraling
- ❌ No pattern tracking (users don't see progress)
- ❌ No guided protocols for specific situations

### User Quotes (from 1,800+ reviews)
> "I need something at 3AM when I'm replaying Tuesday's conversation for the 47th time" — Linda, 67

> "Meditation apps tell me to 'clear my mind' but my brain won't LET me" — Patricia, 69

> "I love The Shift but I want to understand WHY this conversation triggered me" — Margaret, 66

## 5. CORE FEATURES (MVP - Version 1.0)

### 5.1 SPIRAL INTERRUPT (Core Feature #1)

**Problem:** When ruminating, users can't remember 4-step protocols or find the right meditation. They need ONE BUTTON.

**Solution:** Home screen = ONE BIG BUTTON: "I'M SPIRALING"

**User Flow:**
1. Open app → One giant button: "I'M SPIRALING"
2. Tap button → Immediate 90-second guided protocol
3. Protocol uses:
   - Vagal nerve breathing (if paired with Shift: "Grab your necklace")
   - Concrete grounding (5-4-3-2-1 sensory awareness)
   - Spiral naming ("You're ruminating about [conversation/decision/worry]")
4. After 90 seconds: "How do you feel now?" (1-10 scale)
5. Log spiral: Time, trigger (optional), outcome

**Technical Requirements:**
- Instant load (<1 second)
- Works offline (no internet required at 3AM)
- Voice-guided (users can close eyes)
- Option to skip to "just breathing" (experienced users)
- Apple Watch integration (tap watch to start)

**Success Metrics:**
- 80%+ of spirals resolved within 90 seconds
- Users engage 3+ times per day
- 70%+ report feeling "calmer" after protocol

**Solution:** Visual dashboard showing:

**"Your Rumination Map"**
- Heatmap: When do you spiral? (shows 3AM is peak)
- Trigger analysis: What starts spirals? (conversations, texts, decisions)
- Duration trends: Are spirals getting shorter? (proof it's working)
- Success rate: % of spirals interrupted within 90 seconds

**"Your Progress Over Time"**
- Line chart: Spiral frequency (per day)
- Bar chart: Average spiral duration (minutes)

---

### 5.4 THE SHIFT INTEGRATION (Core Feature #4)

**Problem:** 6,000+ Shift buyers want digital companion. Physical + digital = powerful combo.

**Solution:** Bluetooth pairing with The Shift necklace

**How It Works:**
1. **Pairing:** "Do you have The Shift necklace?" → Bluetooth pairing
2. **Detection:** App detects when you're using necklace
3. **Guided Breathing:** Real-time breath coaching via haptic feedback
4. **Auto-Logging:** Automatically logs spiral interrupts (no manual entry)
5. **Reminders:** "You haven't used The Shift in 2 days" (gentle nudge)

**Smart Features:**
- **Pre-Spiral Detection:** "Heart rate elevated + evening time = likely spiral coming"
- **Breathing Coach:** Vibrates to guide 4-count inhale, 10-count exhale
- **Usage Insights:** "You used The Shift 4x today—all after phone calls"

**Upsell Flow (for app-only users):**
- After 7 days: "You've interrupted 21 spirals. The Shift makes this easier."
- Show: "87% of users with The Shift interrupt spirals 2x faster"
- Offer: "$10 app credit if you buy The Shift today"

**Success Metrics:**
- 80% of Shift buyers pair with app
- Paired users have 3x retention vs. app-only
- 15% of app-only users buy The Shift within 90 days

---

### 5.5 NIGHTTIME SUPPORT (Core Feature #5)

**Problem:** 3AM spirals are the #1 pain point. Users need support when they can't sleep.

**Solution:** "3AM Mode"

**How It Works:**
1. **Auto-Detect:** App detects nighttime usage (10PM-6AM)
2. **Dark Mode:** Automatic red light mode (doesn't disrupt sleep)
3. **Sleep-Friendly Protocols:**
   - "Fall Back Asleep" breathing (longer, more sedative)
   - "Body Scan" for tension release
   - "Worry Postponement" (write it down, deal tomorrow)
4. **No Bright Screens:** Voice-guided, minimal visuals
5. **Sleep Correlation:** "You spiral at 3AM after late dinners"

**Special Features:**
- **Voice Journal:** Record spiral thoughts (no typing in dark)
- **Morning Review:** "Here's what you worried about at 3AM" (often feels silly in daylight)
- **Sleep Pattern Analysis:** Correlate spirals with sleep quality (Apple Health integration)

**Success Metrics:**
- 50% of users engage with 3AM mode
- 3AM users have 60% better sleep quality (self-reported)
- "Fall Back Asleep" success rate: 65%

---

### 5.6 COMMUNITY & ACCOUNTABILITY (Secondary Feature)

**Problem:** 65+ women feel alone in their overthinking. They want to know others struggle too.

**Solution:** Optional community features (privacy-first)

**Anonymous Sharing:**
- "Today's Spiral" feed (opt-in, anonymous)
  - "Replayed conversation with daughter for 2 hours"
  - Others respond: "Me too" or share what helped
- No photos, no profiles (text-only for safety)
- Moderated by clinicians (no toxic positivity)

**Accountability Partners:**
- Invite friend/family member
- Share: "I interrupted a spiral today" (not details, just wins)
- They can send: "Proud of you" (simple encouragement)
- NEVER see spiral content (privacy protected)

**Expert Q&A:**
- Monthly live session with rumination therapist
- Submit questions anonymously
- Replay available for all users

**Success Metrics:**

## 8. DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### 8.1 Design Philosophy: "Calm, Not Cute"

**DO:**
- ✅ Generous whitespace (reduces visual overwhelm)
- ✅ Muted colors (emerald, cream, slate - from web brand)
- ✅ Clear hierarchy (one primary action per screen)
- ✅ Reassuring copy ("You're doing great")
- ✅ Progress indicators (show it's finite)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Bright colors (no hot pink, no electric blue)
- ❌ Gamification (no streaks, badges feel juvenile)
- ❌ Cutesy illustrations (treat users with respect)
- ❌ Multiple CTAs (decision fatigue is real)
- ❌ Hidden features (no "swipe to discover")

### 8.2 Visual Design System

**Color Palette** (matches website):
```
Primary: Emerald-600 #059669
Secondary: Amber-500 #F59E0B
Background: Cream-50 #FFFEF5
Text: Slate-900 #0F172A
Accent: Emerald-100 (for highlights)
Error: Red-600 (high contrast)
```

**Typography:**
```
Headings: System Bold (San Francisco), 24-32pt
Body: System Regular, 18pt minimum
Buttons: System Semibold, 20pt
Captions: System Regular, 16pt (never smaller)
```

**Components:**
- **Buttons:** Rounded (12pt), high contrast, large (minimum 60pt height)
- **Cards:** Subtle shadow, 16pt corner radius
- **Icons:** Simple, outlined style (not filled)
- **Inputs:** Large (60pt height), clear labels above

### 8.3 Voice & Tone

**Guiding Principles:**
- **Empathetic, not patronizing**: "This is hard" not "Don't worry!"
- **Clinical, not academic**: Use research but translate to plain English
- **Hopeful, not toxic positive**: "You're making progress" not "Just be happy!"
- **Direct, not verbose**: Short sentences, active voice

**Copy Examples:**

❌ **BAD (Patronizing):**
> "Don't worry, sweetie! Everything will be okay! Just take a deep breath and smile! 😊"

✅ **GOOD (Empathetic):**
> "You're ruminating. Let's interrupt this before it steals another hour."

---

❌ **BAD (Academic):**
> "Utilize metacognitive awareness to identify maladaptive rumination patterns and implement evidence-based intervention strategies."

✅ **GOOD (Clinical but Clear):**
> "Notice when you're spiraling. Name it. Then interrupt it with breathing or grounding."

---

❌ **BAD (Toxic Positivity):**
> "You've got this! Just be present! Choose happiness! Live your best life! 🌟"

✅ **GOOD (Hopeful but Real):**
> "This is hard. You're not broken. You're learning a skill that takes practice."

## 9. MONETIZATION STRATEGY

### 9.1 Pricing Model: Freemium

**FREE (Forever):**
- Unlimited spiral interrupts (core feature always free)
- 7-day trial of F.I.R.E. training (Module 1 only)
- Basic pattern insights (weekly summary)
- Community access (read-only)

**PAID ($9.99/month or $79.99/year):**
- Full F.I.R.E. Protocol (all 4 modules)
- Advanced pattern insights (daily + predictive)
- Custom reframe library (save YOUR techniques)
- 3AM mode (sleep-optimized protocols)
- Priority support (email response <24hr)
- Offline access (download all modules)
- Export reports (PDF for therapist)

**Why This Works:**
- Free tier proves value (users won't pay until it works)
- $9.99 = lower than therapy ($150), higher than Calm ($6.99)
- Annual = $79.99 (save 33%, encourages commitment)
- Upsell at Day 7 (after users see results)

### 9.2 Revenue Projections (Year 1)

**Assumptions:**
- 50,000 downloads (Year 1)
- 10% convert to paid (5,000 subscribers)
- 60% choose monthly, 40% choose annual
- $9.99/mo average (weighted)

**Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):**
```
Month 1: $5,000 (500 subs)
Month 3: $15,000 (1,500 subs)
Month 6: $30,000 (3,000 subs)
Month 12: $50,000 (5,000 subs)
```

**Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) by EOY1:** $600,000

**LTV Calculation:**
- Average subscriber lifetime: 12 months
- Average monthly revenue: $9.99
- LTV = $120 per subscriber

**CAC Calculation:**
- Primary acquisition: Owned quiz traffic (30,000 quiz takers)
- CAC = $0 for existing quiz takers
- Paid ads CAC = $30 (Facebook Ads to 65+ women)
- Blended CAC = $15

**LTV:CAC Ratio = 8:1** (excellent, healthy is 3:1)

### 9.3 Physical Product Upsell

**The Shift Necklace Integration:**

**Upsell Triggers:**
- Day 7: "You've interrupted 21 spirals. Users with The Shift do this 2x faster."
- Day 14: "You're using breathing 12x/day. The Shift makes this easier."
- Day 30: "After 30 days, many users buy The Shift. Here's why."

**Upsell Offer:**
- App users get: $10 off The Shift ($27 instead of $37)
- Bonus: 1 month free premium app with purchase
- Conversion goal: 15% of app users (7,500/year)

**Revenue from Shift Upsells:**
```
7,500 users × $27 = $202,500/year
+ 7,500 users × 1 month free premium = -$75,000
Net: $127,500 additional revenue from physical upsells
