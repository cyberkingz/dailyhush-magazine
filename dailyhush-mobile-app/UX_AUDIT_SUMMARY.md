# DailyHush UX Audit - Executive Summary

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**App Status:** MVP Pre-Launch
**Overall Grade:** B+ (Strong foundation, critical fixes needed)

---

## TL;DR - Must Fix Before Launch

### 5 Critical Issues (Launch Blockers)

1. **Spiral data not saving to database** - Users will see no progress tracking
2. **No error handling for network failures** - App appears broken when offline
3. **Missing empty states** - Confusing first-time experience
4. **No exit flows in onboarding/spiral** - Users feel trapped
5. **Accessibility violations** - Screen readers cannot navigate app

**Estimated Fix Time:** 5 days
**Recommendation:** DO NOT LAUNCH until these are resolved

## User Journey Pain Points

### Journey 1: First-Time User

**Path:** Download → Onboarding → First Spiral

**Critical Pain Points:**
1. Demo completion unclear (need success message)
2. Empty home state not helpful
3. Button text "I'M SPIRALING" may cause anxiety
4. No confirmation after logging spiral

**Recommended Flow Improvements:**
- Show toast when returning from demo: "Great job! Let's continue."
- Replace empty state with encouragement
- Test button copy with users
- Add success screen after spiral: "Well done. Insights updating."

### Journey 2: Return User

**Path:** Open App → Check Progress → Browse Features

**Critical Pain Points:**
1. No pull-to-refresh
2. Static spiral count (not connected to DB)
3. No motivation to explore daily
4. Quote may fail silently

**Recommended Flow Improvements:**
- Add pull-to-refresh gesture
- Connect to real spiral_logs data
- Show daily check-in prompt
- Add quote error state with retry

### Journey 3: Crisis User (3AM)

**Path:** Wake Distressed → Open App → Complete Protocol

**Critical Pain Points:**
1. Pre-check delays protocol start
2. 2.5 minutes feels too long in crisis
3. Trigger logging feels like homework
4. Cannot exit mid-protocol

**Recommended Flow Improvements:**
- Add "Skip to Protocol" for 3AM mode
- Allow trigger logging later
- Add emergency exit with confirmation
- Consider shortening protocol for repeat users

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Launch: 5 Users, 4 Tasks

**Tasks:**
1. Complete onboarding (observe drop-off)
2. Use spiral interrupt
3. Find F.I.R.E. training
4. View insights

**Key Questions to Validate:**
- Does button text cause hesitation?
- Is 90 seconds too long/short?
- Can users exit when needed?
- Do users understand training purpose?

### Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Test with VoiceOver on iOS
- [ ] Test in bright sunlight (contrast)
- [ ] Test on iPhone SE (small screen)
- [ ] Test with Large text size setting

### Technical Testing

- [ ] Airplane mode (offline)
- [ ] Network interruption during save
- [ ] Slow 3G connection
- [ ] Force quit and reopen

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Must Address)

**Data Loss**
- Current: Spiral logs not persisted
- Impact: Users lose all progress, app appears broken
- Mitigation: Implement Supabase + offline queue ASAP

**Accessibility Lawsuit**
- Current: Fails WCAG AA standards
- Impact: Legal liability, excludes users with disabilities
- Mitigation: Fix contrast, add labels, test with assistive tech

**Crisis User Abandonment**
- Current: 2.5-minute protocol may be too long
- Impact: Users in acute distress may abandon mid-flow
- Mitigation: Add skip options, emergency exit, test with users

### Medium Risk (Monitor)

**User Shame/Stigma**
- Current: "I'M SPIRALING" button may trigger negative feelings
- Impact: Avoidance behavior, decreased usage
- Mitigation: Test alternative copy, monitor button tap rates

**Training Drop-Off**
- Current: Dense content, long modules
- Impact: Low completion rates, less educated users
- Mitigation: Reduce text density, add audio, track completion by screen

## Competitive Positioning

### DailyHush Advantages

1. **Speed to Value:** 90-second protocol vs. 10-20 minute meditations
2. **Anonymous:** No signup vs. required accounts
3. **Targeted:** Rumination-specific vs. general anxiety
4. **3AM Mode:** Crisis support vs. daytime-only tools
5. **Evidence-Based:** 5-4-3-2-1 grounding + CBT

### Areas to Improve

1. **Data Visualization:** Competitors have better charts/graphs
2. **Gamification:** Need more streak tracking, badges
3. **Community:** Consider adding peer support (future)
4. **Content:** More training modules needed
5. **Export:** Therapist sharing feature missing
