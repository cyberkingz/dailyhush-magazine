## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Fix Before Launch)

### 1. ❌ App Icon (1024x1024 PNG)

**Status:** MISSING
**Location:** Should be at `assets/icon.png` as 1024x1024

**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

**Requirements:**

---

### 3. ❌ EAS Build Configuration

**Status:** MISSING (`eas.json` file not found)
**Impact:** Cannot build production iOS/Android binaries
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

**What's Needed:**
```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 13.2.0"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "ios": {
        "simulator": true
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "autoIncrement": true,
      "env": {
        "EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL": "$EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL",
        "EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY": "$EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
      }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {
      "ios": {
        "appleId": "your-apple-id@example.com",
        "ascAppId": "your-app-store-connect-app-id",
        "appleTeamId": "YOUR_APPLE_TEAM_ID"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Steps:**
1. Create `eas.json` in root directory
2. Run `eas build:configure`
3. Set up environment variables in EAS (Supabase URLs)
4. Run test build: `eas build --platform ios --profile preview`

---

### 4. ❌ Notification Icon Missing

**Status:** MISSING
**Location:** `assets/notification-icon.png` (referenced in app.json but doesn't exist)
**Impact:** Build will fail if notifications are used
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Requirements:**
- White foreground icon on transparent background
- 96x96 pixels (Android)
- PNG format with alpha channel
- Simple, recognizable design

**Quick Fix:**
- Create simple white icon from main app icon
- Or use a simple bell/notification symbol

---

### 5. ❌ No Crash Reporting

**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Impact:** Cannot diagnose production crashes
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH (but can launch without it)

**Recommended:** Sentry

**Setup:**
```bash
npx expo install @sentry/react-native
```

**Configuration:**
```typescript
// app/_layout.tsx
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN',
  environment: __DEV__ ? 'development' : 'production',
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

**Note:** Can technically launch without this, but HIGHLY recommended for production monitoring.

---

## ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY (Recommended Before Launch)

### 6. ⚠️ .env File Security Issue

**Status:** ⚠️ WARNING
**Location:** `.env` file tracked in git
**Impact:** Supabase API keys exposed in repository
**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Issue:**
The `.env` file contains:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://kisewkjogomsstgvqggc.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGci...
```

**These are PUBLIC keys (anon key)**, so exposure is not critical, but it's still bad practice.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Remove from git history
git rm --cached .env
git commit -m "Remove .env from git tracking"

# Ensure .gitignore includes it
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

**Note:** The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`, but it appears to be tracked in git history.

---

### 7. ⚠️ No App Store Description

**Status:** NOT WRITTEN
**Impact:** Cannot complete App Store listing
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Requirements:**
- Clear explanation of app purpose
- Highlight key features (F.I.R.E., Shift integration, 3AM Mode)
- Mention subscription pricing (once implemented)
- NO medical claims (state it's NOT therapy)
- Include crisis resources mention

**Draft Template:**
```
DailyHush helps women ages 55-70 interrupt rumination spirals with
science-backed techniques.

FEATURES:

• Pattern Insights: Understand your triggers and progress
• The Shift Necklace: Optional Bluetooth device for guided breathing
• 3AM Mode: Voice journaling for late-night worries

IMPORTANT: DailyHush is NOT a medical device or substitute for

Lifeline) or 911.

Designed specifically for women experiencing rumination, overthinking,
and anxiety patterns.
