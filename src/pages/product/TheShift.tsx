  // FAQs
  const faqs = [
    {
      question: 'How does it actually work?',
      answer: "The necklace has a small opening that naturally extends your exhale. When you exhale for 2x longer than you inhale, it activates your vagus nerve - your body's 'calm down' switch. This counteracts overthinking/anxiety.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I have to wear it all the time?',
      answer: "No. Many people wear it daily as a reminder, but you can also keep it in your pocket or purse and use only when spiraling. Whatever works for you.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will people think it's weird I'm breathing through jewelry?",
      answer: "It looks like you're taking a slow breath. Most people won't even notice. (And if they do, just say 'anxiety relief tool' - you'll be surprised how many ask where to get one!)",
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does it take to work?',
      answer: "90 seconds (2-3 slow breaths). The first breath interrupts the spiral. By the third breath, you'll feel noticeably calmer.",
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I lose it or it breaks?',
      answer: "It's stainless steel (durable), but if anything happens within 60 days, email us and we'll replace it free.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Does this replace therapy/medication?',
      answer: "No. This is a TOOL, not a replacement for professional help. It works alongside therapy/medication to give you something physical to do when spiraling.",
    },
    {
      question: 'What material is it made from?',
      answer: "Medical-grade stainless steel - hypoallergenic, nickel-free, and won't tarnish. The chain is adjustable from 18-24 inches to fit everyone.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use it while driving?',
      answer: "Yes, it's safe to use while driving (unlike meditation apps). Just keep your eyes on the road and breathe through the necklace when you feel stress rising.",
    },
