## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd dailyhush-mobile-app
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create/update `.env` file with your Supabase credentials:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# OR run directly on iOS simulator
npm run ios

# OR run on Android emulator
npm run android
```

### 4. Test on Physical Device

1. Install **Expo Go** from the App Store
2. Scan the QR code from the terminal
3. App will load on your device
